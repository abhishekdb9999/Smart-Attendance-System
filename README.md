# Smart Attendance System



## Overview

The Smart Attendance System is a project aimed at automating the process of taking attendance in various settings such as schools, offices, or events. It utilizes Arduino Uno along with LCD, I2C module, and GSM module for efficient and user-friendly attendance management.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for registering and marking attendance.
- Real-time feedback displayed on LCD for user confirmation and system status.
- Flexible configuration for various identification methods (RFID, fingerprint, QR code).
- Option for local data storage (using SD card) or remote data transmission (via GSM).
- Easily customizable for specific requirements and settings.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements:

- Arduino Uno
- LCD Module (with I2C interface)
- I2C Module
- GSM Module
- RFID Reader (optional)
- SD Card Module (optional)

### Software Requirements:

- Arduino IDE
- Libraries for LCD, GSM, RFID (if applicable)

### Installation and Setup:

1. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub.
2. Install the necessary libraries for LCD, GSM, and RFID (if applicable).
3. Connect the hardware components according to the provided wiring diagram.
